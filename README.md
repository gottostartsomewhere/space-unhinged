# Space, But Unhinged 

**Space, But Unhinged** is an interactive 3D solar system experiment where realism takes a back seat and chaos drives the simulation. Planets move, orbits break, and physics behaves more like a suggestion than a rule.

Built as a creative coding project, this isn’t about accuracy : it’s about motion, exploration, and controlled disorder.
